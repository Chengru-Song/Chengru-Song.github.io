**What is Github Pages？**

`Github Pages` is `Github` a static page hosting service.It is designed for users can directly managed by making the warehouse individual, organization or project page.reference：https://help.github.com/articles/what-is-github-pages/
Can say is equivalent to a static content can be directly use git management server, there are many people who will use it to host your own personal blog (use `Jekyll`, `Pelican`, this kind of static page generation tool) or HTML5 small game in this post.Such a good thing, of course, is also limited.

**Github Pages limited：**
* All documents must not exceed 1 GB of storage in the warehouse.
* The bandwidth of the page limit is lower than 100 GB per month or per month 100000 requests.
* An hour can only deploy up to 10 static web sites.
