# WMAPE

Advantage: The advantage of this metric over MAPE is that this overcomes the 'infinite error' issue.
Key word: Evaluation
Usage: A measure of prediction accuracy of a forecasting method.

WMAPE: weighted mean absolute percentage error'

A measure of prediction accuracy of a forecasting method. 

$$\begin{equation}
WMAPE = \frac{\sum^n_{t=1}|A_t - F_t|}{\sum^n_{t=1}|A_t|}
\end{equation}$$

$A_t$ is a vector of actual data and $F_t$ is a vector of forecast

The advantage of this metric over [MAPE](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MAPE) is that this overcomes the 'infinite error' issue.
